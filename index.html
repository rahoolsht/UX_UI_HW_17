          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi I am Rahul a Toronto based UX/UI designer who is also a sucker for stories. 
            I like bridging gap’s between problems and solutions.I enjoy learning about human psychology which helps me focusing on creating user-centric designs while keeping empathy.
            Believing in no frustrations designs, where others may use meditation as a source of keeping themselves calm I use sketching and photography as my source.</p>
          <h1>Skills</h1>
          <h3>User Research and user Empathy</h3>
          <p>There’s no style over substance. 
            Laying user research with past, present and future references. 
            This helps me think in different times and then link them with my target users group and stakeholders mindset.</p>
          <h3>Wire-framing and Pencil sketching</h3>
          <p>Not reinventing the wheel here but using inspirations from previous work, nature and daily routine. 
            Putting down ideas on paper brings them a certainty of motion.</p>
            <h3>Interactive Designing</h3>
            <p>Running electricity to my Frankenstein. Colours, Typography and micro-interactions with great quality photographs help me build the style guide,
              which results in building my designs digitally.</p>

            <h1>Side Work</h1>
            <p>When ever I get the feeling of taking in fresh air and gazing into nature I pick up my camera and capture them as memories. 
              And for total isolation Pencil Art is my go to place, this is complimented by music as it a part of everyone's life ( I believe ).A to do list of mine is to travel all the states within Canada and photograph the beauty Canada has to offer. 
              Thanks for visiting.</p>
